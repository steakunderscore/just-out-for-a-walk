After visiting Rotterdam, the largest port in Europe, we went to Antwerp, the
second largest port in Europe. While we were there we went on a port tour to
check out the local industry.

In Antwerp we stayed with two girls (Nina and Karen) we met on our flight from
Oslo to Amsterdam.  Nina was seated next to us on the plane and really seemed
to struggle with the changes in altitude. We weren't sure if she was going to
survive the trip without throwing up and when we landed I have never seen
anyone so happy to be on the ground. She became very chatty and invited us to
come and visit her in Antwerp.

On our first night there, Nina decided we were going to eat a Belgium feast of
mussels and chips.  We went to the supermarket and got 4 kilos of mussels each.
While Nina cooked up the mussels we visied the 'friteur'. After looking at the
different container sizes we decided that we would need two of the largest
containers of fried chips. This turned out to be enough chips to feed the
Belgium army.

After our meal we picked up some city bikes and explored the Antwerp
night-life.
