During our stay in Rotterdam, we hired a car and spent the day driving around
various parts of the Delta Works. The Delta Works are a series of dams, sluices
and storm surge barriers constructed to protect a significant part of the
southwest of the Netherlands from the sea.

The motivation to construct the Delta Works came about after a large flood in
1953 that killed over 1,800 people in the Netherlands. One of the highlights of
the day was visiting a museum dedicated to the floods that was housed in the
top of one of the caissons used to close one of the last holes in the dike
formed during the flood.

The Eastern Schelde storm surge barrier was impressive. It has a 4km stretch of
huge sluice gates that allow the saltwater to still pass through but can be
closed when needed.
