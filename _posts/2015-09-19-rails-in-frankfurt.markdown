When we were in Bergen we made friends with a couple from Frankfurt who invited
us to stay in their home (Uli and Almuth). After organising to stay with them
we found out there was a Rails Girls Frankfurt event on that weekend and so we
signed ourselves up.

Rails Girls is an organisation for getting girls interested in technology. The
event we went to consisted of exercises showing how to set up a website using
Ruby on Rails. There was a group of about 50 girls (including Holly) and about
15 tutors (including Henry and Wim). It was a really fun, intense time.

After that we spent a nice time with Uli and Almuth hanging out and checking
out the old style houses in their town and the Witches tower.
