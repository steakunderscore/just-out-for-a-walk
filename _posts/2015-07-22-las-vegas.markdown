Mitchel and Rochelle were kind enough to lend us their car for a couple of
days, which meant it's Vegas time! Well, kind of. Actually wanted to see the
Hoover dam.

It was a pretty epic drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. It's not a drive I
would want to do every day, but really cool coming from green New Zealand. The
desert just keeps on going. It seemed like it would never end.

After arriving in Vegas, we found somewhere to stay, had a look around. We
booked in at a place which had a casino full of old people and smelt awful.
Just a reminder as to how good New Zealand's smoking laws are.

That evening we had a look around, checked out some of the buildings and Planet
Hollywood. After which we caught a show.

The next day came the main attraction, lake Mead and the Hoover Dam! It's a lot
bigger than I had realised. We went on a power plant and dam tour. I won't
describe it, it's all on Wikipedia. But here are some snaps.

Driving in the states wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Although it was
quite intense rolling down the freeway at 80 MPH ( ~135 km/h ). But there is
one thing I need to set straight before rumours are set and history is written.
I was involved in a fender bender while driving. I had stopped for a red light
when we were hit. The damage to Mitchel and Rochelle's car wasn't too bad, but
I did feel bad for having it happen. On the bright side, the car made it to
Vegas and it's all been covered by insurance.
