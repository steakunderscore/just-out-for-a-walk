We flew from Istanbul to Paris and spent a few lovely days there before heading
onto London.

We spent some of our time there wandering around the streets, visiting a few of
the tourist sites, like the Eiffel Tower and the Notre-Dame Cathedral.

On our second day in Paris we went to the Orsay museum, an art museum that is
in a former railway station. It is not just the artwork that is beautiful at
Orsay but also the building. In the three or four hours we spent there we only
saw around half of it. If we ever returned to Paris I would definitely revisit
this museum.

After spending a couple of days in Paris we went to stay with a friend who
lives in Versaille. About a year earlier he had stayed in our flat in
Wellington for a couple of weeks. We were surprised to see he had swapped his
Bob Marley t-shirt for a sharp looking suit. It was really nice to catch up
with him and meet his family.

While in Versailles we went for a walk in the Versailles Palace gardens. It was
definitely the wrong time of year for visiting the gardens but it was still a
nice place to spend half a day.

On leaving Paris, we had one of the nicest border control crossings we have
ever had. It was really strange as almost all of the border guards were smiling
and extra cheerful. One of them even cracked a joke! Tr√®s bizarre.
