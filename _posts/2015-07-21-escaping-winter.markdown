When we left for the airport in Wellington it was raining, windy and very
chilly. We were very happy to arrive in Los Angeles with its clear blue skies
and hot sun. We had finally escaped winter! It was really good to finally see
where Mitchel and Rochelle (Michelle) lived and to meet some of the people they
hung out with. It was also good to see some of Rochelle's paintings hanging on
a wall and not just as photos on a computer screen. During our time in Los
Angeles we watched skateboarders at Venice Beach, went swimming in the sea,
went to an american prom party, ate delicous tacos, went to a roof-top bar, saw
the spaceship Endeavour. It was a really relaxing time and the perfect way to
start our trip.
