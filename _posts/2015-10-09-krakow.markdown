Krakow is a great city for tourists. It has a fascinating history, many
interesting sights, a beautiful castle and best of all it's own fire-breathing
dragon!

Being a fan of hearty food and pickles, I really enjoyed eating out here. I
have decided that I need more pickled food in my life.

One of my favorite foods was Å»urek, a soup based on fermented rye - it's sour
and creamy and often has slices of kielbasa sausage or a hard-boiled egg added.

Henry got into Pierogi - Polish dumplings filled with all sorts. I had tried
Pierogi back in New Zealand when Emilia, a friend originally from Poland, took
on the challenge of making me a gluten free version.

We took a day-trip out to see Wieliczka salt mine. Founded in the 12th century,
it was mined up until 1996. The miners created dining halls, chapels and a huge
underground cathedral below the ground. From memory the deepest we got to was
200m. Like most underground places, the mine was a peaceful place to be.
However in saying that it would also make a fantastic set for a horror movie.

Our next day-trip was to Auschwitz, the infamous Nazi concentration camp. This
was a harrowing experience being in a place where so many horrific things
happened to so many people. One of the more moving exhibits were mug-shots of
camp prisoners which put a face to the people who faced the tragedies and
horrors of Auschwitz.
