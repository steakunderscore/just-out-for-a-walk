The drive away from Mostar was just as beautiful as the drive there. We arrived
in Sarajevo to find another culturally diverse city.

On the first night we took a walking tour with a young guy about our age who
was passionate about the diversity that the different religious groups brought
to Sarajevo and was sad to have lost the integration they once had. Until late
in the 20th century, it was the only major European city to have a mosque,
Catholic church, Orthodox church and synagogue within the same neighborhood.
Before the war 30% of marriages were between different ethnicities.

We also went on a tour that focused on what life was like during the 90's siege
of Sarajevo. This was taken by a man who worked for the police during the
siege. On this tour we visited the tunnel that was constructed under the
airport and was used to transport things in and out of the city during the
siege.

Sarajevo is a great town to walk around, with many interesting things to see.
Highlights were an old fortress overlooking the city, the Bazaar, the different
mosques, churches and synagogues. The city is surrounded by beautiful hills and
mountains. We took a day-trip out to see a waterfall up in the hills and also
to get a break from the air pollution in the city which was quite bad.

Looking around Sarajevo it seemed like a city that had so much potential before
the war. Unfortunately it seems like it is struggling to get back on its feet.
