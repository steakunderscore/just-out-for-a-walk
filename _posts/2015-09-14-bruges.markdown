While in Antwerp we made sure to watch the movie In Bruges. Because, we were
heading to Bruges.

Bruges lived up to it's name as being a romantic city. It's narrow cobble stone
streets filled with chocolate stores. Most of our time here was spent walking
the streats, doing general touristy stuff. We went on a canal boat trip, drank
Belgium beer and went on a brewery tour of the De Halve Mann brewery.

It was pretty, nice place to explore and relax. Luckly nobody fell out of the
tower.
