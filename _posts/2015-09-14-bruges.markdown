While in Antwerp we made sure to watch the movie In Bruges because we were
heading to Bruges.

Bruges lived up to it's name as being a romantic city. It is made up of narrow cobble stone
streets filled with chocolate stores. Most of our time here was spent walking
the streats, doing general touristy stuff. We went on a canal boat trip, drank
Belgium beer and went on a brewery tour of the De Halve Mann brewery.

It was a scenic, nice place to explore and relax. Luckily nobody fell out of the
tower......
