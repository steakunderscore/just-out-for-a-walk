After staying with Irina, we were keen to visit more people from The
Netherlands. We went to stay with Wietske and Jan in the little village called
Vries.

The older couple had been living on the property for 40 years, keeping horses
and cows while raising their family. Their jobs were both quite interesting,
Jan a computer science lecture at the local university. Wietske an
environmental science teacher.

It was a shame, a couple of days before we arrived, Wietske was in a car accident while driving home
with a friend. She was feeling the effects a bit and had to lie down from time to time.
It also meant she could not ride a horse or bike.

Wietske normally would take visitors on a geological bike ride around the area,
but instead this time drew a map and gave the explanations prior to us leaving.
We went out for a lovely bike ride around the area exploring. While I don't
think we got as much from it as if she had come with us, it was still
interesting.

It was also interesting hearing about Wietske's days as an environmental
activist. She had plenty of stories to tell about her involvement with climate
change issues and the protection of the Wadden Sea ecology.
