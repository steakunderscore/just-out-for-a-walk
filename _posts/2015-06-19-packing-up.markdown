# Holly, should we keep this?

It's only when you go to move (well, remove in this case) you stuff, you
realise how much you have. A couple of bikes, dive gear, tramping kit. I still
had my skis from last using them in Christchurch. We have spent a few weekends
now selling stuff. Holly put a lot of work into getting the flat ready for flat
viewings. But it's finally getting there.

We're three weeks out from finishing at our jobs. Then only a few days after
that we head to LA. There is much excitement. Although it's been drowned a fair
bit by sorting out, selling and disposing of most of our belongings.
