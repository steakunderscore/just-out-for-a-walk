For our last few weeks in Wellington we stayed in Jesse and Michelle's spare
room.  It was a hectic time tying up loose ends and saying our goodbyes. Our
last night with Alana was very memorable. She invited us along to a c√®ilidh
where we drank whisky, danced crazy scottish dances and witnessed a haggis
ceremony.
