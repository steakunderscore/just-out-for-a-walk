Kosovo was a place of surprises. Surprises included good coffee, good local
ketchup and friendly locals. Unfortunately the weather was bad while we were
here and we didn't get to see much of the sights, so not much to say except I
would love to come back one day.

Peja lies at the foot of the Accursed Mountains and Rugova Canyon. It is a
stunning location but sadly the bad weather kept us from exploring much.

Prizren is a pretty little town. It has the best-preserved old town in Kosovo.
We got to see some of it through the heavy rainfall.
