Another couch-surfing gem was found in Zadar, Croatia. We spent most of our
time here with Natasha from Moldova, a country whose existence I questioned
until seeing it on Google maps. Moldova is a poor country with rampant
corruption. Recently 1 billion dollars disappeared from the countries main
banks. This is equivalent to an eighth of the countries GDP!

Natasha showed us around her favorite spots including the sea organ - tubes
located underneath a set of large marble steps that are played by the seawaves.
We pretended to be students at the local university, eating at the student
cafeteria and watching a movie for a sociology class. With Natasha we joined
the retired-age people for a daily swim in the ocean. The water was too cold
for the locals under the age of 70 but it was fine for us.
