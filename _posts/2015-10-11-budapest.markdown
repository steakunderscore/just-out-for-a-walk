Our trip to Hungary got off to a bad start when our night bus didn't turn up.
(Orangeways). Apparently this is a normal thing for this company. So instead of
the bus we got a ride the next day with a Polish girl who had just moved to
Budapest.

Budapest had lots of things to see and do so we spent our time there
sight-seeing and trying Hungarian wine. Then it was off to Szchesferhavar
because we like staying in places where we can't pronounce the name.
