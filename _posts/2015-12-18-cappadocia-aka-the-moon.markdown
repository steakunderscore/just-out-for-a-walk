After a week in Istanbul, we headed to Cappadocia. Going there is a great way to feel like you are on another planet as the landscape are other-worldly. There were many places to explore and we were sad to leave as we could have easily spent another week hiking there. Cappadocia is famous for it’s unusual rock formations - ‘fairy chimneys’, surreal landscapes and the houses and underground cave networks carved into the soft volcanic rock. Because it is in Turkey you don’t have the excessive access restrictions for safety reasons like you would in a lot of other places. This means that you really get to wander around and explore the surreal landscape and features relatively freely.

In Cappadocia we visited Derinkuyu underground city, Ihlara valley and Selime monastery

While we were in Cappadocia we had an unusual experience. We were walking down a quiet street when a car pulled over and out tumbled 6 high-schoolers who walked over to us and whipped out their phones to start filming us while asking awkward questions in english. They knew enough english to ask us some simple questions but not enough to explain to us what was going on. It was very confusing. A friend of ours cleared up the mystery later, apparently if you don’t have enough marks to pass english at high-school you could get extra marks by filming yourself having a conversation with an english-speaker.
