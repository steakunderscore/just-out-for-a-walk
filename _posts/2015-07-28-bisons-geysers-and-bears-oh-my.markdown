What a wicked place, with such awesome people!

So we flew into Salt Lake City with Mitchel and Rochelle, where George and
Hannah picked us up in the rental van. After grabbing some lunch we made our
way up towards the log cabin we booked in Island Park, Idaho. As with
everything in the States, it was a long drive. When we got there we had a bit
of a dilemma getting into the place. So we ended up finding a motel about 5
miles down the road for the night.

The next few days we spent in Yellowstone National Park, 'Merica's gift to
the world. I can't really describe how amazing the place was so here are some
photos.

The last day we had in the area we went to Grand Teton National Park. We took a
boat across a small lake then walked up one of the old glacial valleys. Only
deserves more pictures.

It was an amazing time in the area. Only beaten by being able to spend quality
time with family.
