New York was, as you would expect, a very cool city.

We ate so much tasty food while we were there that some exercise was required
and so we started going for a run in Central Park every other day.  One of the
highlights of our time here was 'the-George-Jenkins-City-Bike-Experience'. This
tour took us all over New York, from China-Town to Little Italy to the New
World Trade Centre to Times Square and to Wall Street.

Hannah and George (Horge) took us out one night to a baseball game. The New
York Mets won over the Washington team. It was quite a cool atmosphere in the
stadium, but it's a pretty slow sport to watch. The next day when walking around
Brooklyn, we came across some social baseball games. Although less skilled,
there were more points scored and much more action.

Heading over the bridge to Brooklyn for kai was sweet. We visited a couple of
Georges favourite places. One of the best was Fette Sau, this canteen style BBQ place where you
order your cooked meat by the pound. It was too easy to over eat but luckily George had done this before (many times)
and ordered the perfect amount.

It was really nice seeing where Horge lived and what their home city was like.
It was special to visit them.
