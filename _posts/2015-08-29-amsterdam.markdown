Amsterdam mostly consisted of walking and biking around the city, just being a
tourist. Amsterdam is also where we meet up with Wim.

The first couple of days were spent just catching up on life after hiking in
Norway. After having just finished reading Anne Frank's diary, it only made
sense to visit the Annex.

The following day we biked out to Amstelveen, mostly to get out of the tourists
and take a look at some windmills. There was lots of cheese and a BBQ in the
park.
